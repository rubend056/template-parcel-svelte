		Oh, and if you wanna understand who takes all these files and packs them together
		into something nice the browser can use, read about
		<a href="https://parceljs.org/">Parcel</a>, there's a lot of frameworks, but
		this one <b>just works</b>, barely a config file in sight, and is crazy fast.
		Ik it's commercial and all, but there's not much vendor lock-in, u don't even
		have to read their docs for u to use it.
